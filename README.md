# An exploration of data generation methods

I don't know about you, but I have troubled myself over what the data means when working on Machine Learning algorithms. Most of the time, the dataset iss to big to have an intuitive sense of what the data represents and how it related to the algorithm which uses it. I've found that there is no solution to this other than experience, and one way of gaining experience is by creating the data itself from scratch. 
This repository was created for this reason alone. Just data generation.
